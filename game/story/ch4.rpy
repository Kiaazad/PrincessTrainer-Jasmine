    jaf "After some education, he will infiltrate the palace and pushes the enemy to desperation."
    jaf "He will expose the rotten core of their rulers, bare for everyone to see."
    jaf "He will deliver the ultimate humiliation."
    me "Can you stop talking about me in third person jafar? I'm standing right here. And I think I should feel insulted."
    me "It sounds harder than I imagined."
    me "Me? A commoner in the palace?"
    jaf "It is hard, but don't worry my friend, you will be fine."
    jaf "More than fine, in fact, you might find pleasure in it."
    me "Pleasure is good. I'm listening."
    jaf "Ah yes pleasure"
    jaf "The ultimate goal. The driving force of nature. Better than all the wealth in the world."
    me "I don't think any pleasure can top all the wealth in the world jafar."
    jaf "It would, you don't understand it yet, I'll have to write a book on that as well."
    jaf "Anyways, you need to make some money to buy clothing."
    me "Can't you give me some money or the clothing with magic?"
    jaf "Of course I can, I have the absolute power! The universe is mine to command."
    jaf "But that might count as your wish, I don't want risking something that valuable."
    me "Good point, I would never think that ahead, no wonder you became a Vizier."
    jaf "Yes, yes, I'm amazing. Now listen to me."
    jaf "You need to establish yourself as a wise man, solving peoples problems."
    jaf "Once you're known for holding the solution to every problem. You can easily enter the palace."
    jaf "In my absence, you will have no problem establishing yourself in the palace."
    me "Like Malik and Hosein?"
    jaf "I almost forgot about those two rats. They can interrupt our plan, we need to get rid of them too."
    jaf "here are your quests, money, clothing amd combat training, did I miss anything?"
    me "I'm hungry."
    jaf "Ah yes that too."
    jaf "Let us get out and start executing our plan."

    jaf "Now try it."
    "There will be a check to see if you have gone into the menu."
    jaf "Excellent, only you can see or feel the lamp, it should be safe hanging from your waist."

    me "I'll try."
    jaf "Well then, off you go, I'll be in the lamp if you need me."
