    jaf "Alright, I've devised a fool proof plan. "
    jaf "The fool would be you, of course."
    jaf "After some education, he will infiltrate the palace and push the enemy to desperation."
    jaf "He will expose the rotten core of their rulers, bare for everyone to see."
    jaf "Then, he will deliver the ultimate humiliation."
    me "Can you stop talking about me in third person, Jafar? I'm standing right here. And I think I should feel insulted."
    me "Hmmm, I guess a commoner in the palace will be harder than I thought."
    me "Do you mean me?"
    jaf "Yes, of course. It will be hard, but I'm sure I can pull it off. You'll be fine."
    jaf "More than fine, in fact. You might find pleasure in it."
    me "Heheheh, pleasure is good. I'm listening."
    jaf "Ah yes. Pleasure"
    jaf "The ultimate goal. The driving force of nature. Better than all the wealth in the world."
    me "I don't think any pleasure can top all the wealth in the world, jafar."
    jaf "It would, you just don't understand it yet. I'll have to write a book on that as well."
    jaf "Anyways, you need to make some money to buy clothing."
    me "Can't you give me some money or the clothing with magic?"
    jaf "Of course I can, I have the absolute power! The universe is mine to command."
    jaf "But that might count as your wish. I don't want risking something that valuable."
    me "Good point, I would never think that ahead. No wonder you became a Vizier."
    jaf "Yes, yes, I'm amazing. Now listen to me."
    jaf "You need to establish yourself as a wise man, solving people's problems."
    jaf "Once you're known for holding the solution to every problem, you can easily enter the palace."
    jaf "In my absence, you will have no problem establishing yourself as a person of importance."
    me "Like Malik and Hosein?"
    jaf "I almost forgot about those two rats. They can interrupt our plan, we need to get rid of them too."
    jaf "So I guess that's everything: Your mission, wealth, your attire and combat training. Did I miss anything?"
    me "Well, food. I'm starving."
    jaf "Ah yes, that too."
    jaf "Let us get out and start executing our plan."
    me "You mean..."

    jaf "You're a part of it, that makes it our plan."
    jaf "Anyways, you need a way back into the lamp, let me see."
    jaf "To enter the lamp, look up and do this with your hand. that should do the trick."
    $ quick_menu = True
    jaf "Now try it."
    "There will be a check to see if you have gone into the menu."
    jaf "Excellent, only you can see or feel the lamp, it should be safe hanging from your waist."
    jaf "Just don't hold or rub it in public. You'll look crazy doing that."
    jaf "And try to not speak to me in front of people either."
    me "I'll try."
    jaf "Well then, off you go. I'll be in the lamp if you need me."
