# Known issues:
Lamp Tour Menu:
- Nothing is labeled.
- The menu is different from the one used whenever you return to the lamp.
- The Jar Room is closed.
- The Menu Room is closed.
- The Setting Room is closed.

- The “Cash in Hand” quest turn in is bugged. When you reload a save, other than the first auto one, you can no longer turn in the quest to Jafar.
>> the qlog.has returns False after a load.

- In the quest log, the [Filter] button doesn’t really look like a button. I think someone could easily miss the fact that you can click on it to scroll through filter options.

"Thanks. It was so dark that I couldn't see where to click to go back to the tower! Admittedly my eyesight isn't very good."
>> we nee ease of access options

# Explained:
- You can miss getting the quest “Books for Jafar” if you decided to view the lamp on your own. Is there another way to start the quest?
>> Missing quests are intentional

- “Books for School” and “Planted Evidence” don’t show up under the [Filter: All] tab in the quest log.
>> The list can be dragged up

What’s the difference between a “Finished” quest and a “Completed” quest?
>> A finished quest is delivered and done

Combat:
- Does the [Add] button do anything while in the manage settings?
>> It's for adding more fighters to the team if you have any

- How many attacks are supposed to be on the combat toolbar at the start? Without a sword, two show up automatically, “Punch” and “Kick”. With a sword, only “Punch” shows up automatically.
>> Depends on the level and it's somehow random

- Sleazy Ahmad, isn’t always in the Poor Section. He seems to vanish from time to time, and you can’t click on him/talk to him.
>> It's the result of shifts system, the characters can go to eat, sleep or travel and wouldn't always be there

- The way to exit menus is inconsistent. Sometimes you click the button on the right, sometimes it’s on the left. The same issues extends to the Bazaar location, instead of exiting by clicking down, you exit the street by clicking up.
>> The placement of buttons differs for each location since they lead into each other and there's multiple ways to exit


# Can't duplicate
- Your mouse pointer can vanish if you tab out while in combat. To make it reappear you have to move it around and try to click on a button or combat toolbar.
>> it is possible that the mouse pointer disappears because of inactivity,in that case it's an engine thing andd happens anywhere in the game
