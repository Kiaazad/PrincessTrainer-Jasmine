The art style is subject to change. Although we are strict on the style, we're also open to the artists whom want to bring their own flavor to the game's art, if it improves the feel of the game.   
Overall, we prefer exaggerated body proportions and gestures.

### Music
The music is themed around lazy, desert days. It feels like it's too hot to be energetic.  
It doesn't need to be purely middle-eastern or Arabic. Just choosing the right scales should be enough to give it the distinct flavor.

### Target Platforms
Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android

### Controls and UI
The game's interface and features will be designed to be played and navigated with just a mouse, or a touch screen, or with only a keyboard, WASD style.
