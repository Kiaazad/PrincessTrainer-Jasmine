# Writing guide
Here are few point to keep in mind when writing for this game:

The Tumbleweed example, I initially name the item camel thorn since it's a native species, but it's not that known in European ad American countries that are the target market for the game, so we had to computerize and go for something better known.

The cursing had to be adapted as well to make it easier for our writers, we decided to use common English and avoid giving the characters speaking patterns, middle easterns do use these words, they just don't make it into the media that other countries see from the place.

Don't hesitate to include pop culture or easter eggs, specially when it comes to what Jafar says. Genies apparently Genies have access to the real world at the present time.
The fat fuck line is a nod to one of my favorite comedians,I can't remember if it was Lewis black or somebody else though, in fact that line is quoted verbatim including the name Abdul.

This game is a different point of view on the original story, this time we explore why Jafar was the good guy this whole time and the reason for his actions.
Naturally when we follow Jafar's daily life, we find out that he has a whole life behind few appearances in the story. He has a family, friends, eats and shops. He knows people and has conversations with them. Everything he did was an attempt to correct problems that the incompetent Sultan caused, by any means necessary.

Jafar isn't a villain, Just a concerned citizen in a position to do something about it.

While it is true that Jafar cares more about his own interest that is getting his revenge, he always cared about people of Agrabah and their well being. Abdul is one of them that he personally knows. As long as he doesn't stand in the way, Jafar wouldn't mind helping him get something on the side.

Abdul is the name we have given to the fish vendor that appears in the first movie when we have chosen him to be the player character.
He's a peasant it's mentioned in the artist guide for characters: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ABauU6N4Qe8s4jN0F5tuBOT--ujXP33bczT52Q8TmKE/edit?usp=sharing

I can see Jafar as a high ranking educated man to try being funny and end up embarrassing himself, specially since he's a new Genie and haven't got the hang of being funny yet.

In the second movie one of the rules mentioned is: Genies can't kill. And Jafar's response was "but you'll be amazed what you can live through"
We will test this rule and see how much harm jafar can do without violating this it. The best place for that is when he is granting wishes.

We have complete freedom on the language we use in the game as long as we consider the level of education and the vocabulary available to each character.

The majority of wishes will end up with Abdul getting screwed by evoking Jafar's anger, if the player plays the game right, they never get to choosing a wish till the very end.
