# signing
The idea behind signing is:
Each writer or script writer goes through a chunk of the story that usually resides under a label to see if it is finished and in no need of further change, in that case they will comment their name in front of the label to mark it, once we get enough signs on a label we can be confident that it will remain unchanged and ready for translation. Here's an example:

```python
label jasmines_speech: #Kia #Pook #HarukaNami
    jas "People of agrabah, I'm proud to announce..."
    jas "Bread we have a new Verier!"
    jas "He is Abdul Example, the man we came to trust and love."
    abd "Thank you, thank you, your highness."
    abd "I hope I can serve Agrabah and bring it to it's former glory."
    abd "Make Agrabah great again!"
    abd "Make Agrabah great again!"
    abd "Make Agrabah great again!"
    ppl "Make Agrabah great again!"
    abd "Now if you'll excuse us, we have to attend important matters."
    ppl "Make Agrabah great again!"
    ppl "Make Agrabah great again!"
    return
```

This will give us a good idea where got more worked on and where in the game we should direct our attention
