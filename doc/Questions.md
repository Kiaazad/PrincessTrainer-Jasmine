## Q1- What's the best way to give the units(enemies) their spell set?  
The player will learn the spells from books, quests, training and other methods. For others we need an automated system.  
Each Archetype has a list of spells/skills they can perform and all we have to do is chose some of them and give them to the newly created units. The options are:

1) Completely random.  
Right now the code choses a spell at random and adds it to the acquired spells.

2) Random in order.  
The problem with random is: We can't be sure which spells the units will get and it's possible that a high level warrior draws the short straw and end up with a kick and tickle, or a level two Wizard that gets one awesome but not enough mana to cast it.  
To remedy that we can set them to be obtained in order at random levels.

3) Obtaining them at specific levels
We can set a minimum level required for each spell and give them to the units the old boring style.
